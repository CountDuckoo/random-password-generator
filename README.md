# Random Password Generator

## Description

This project allows for generation of a random password. The user can choose which types of characters to use, in any combination of lowercase letters, capital letters, digits, and some special characters. (see here: https://owasp.org/www-community/password-special-characters)

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Open the website in GitHub Pages using this link: https://countduckoo.github.io/random-password-generator/

Click the Generate Password Button, and answer the prompts for whether to include the different types of characters in your generated password, followed by the number of characters in your password. If you do not select any types of characters, or enter a password length that is not a number or is not between 8 and 128, inclusive, you will be prompted to repeat that selection step. The password will always include at least one of each type of character selected.
